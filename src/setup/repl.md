# REPL

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is one of the most useful environments if you want to try a new programming language. There is a few options for Scala:
* sbt console - help us import the dependencies in the project, can be used directly in this way.

* amm - most efficient tool developed by [lihaoyi](https://github.com/lihaoyi), it has user friendly features like syntax highlight, multiple line input, etc. Install with following command:

  ```shell
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/amm https://git.io/vdNv2 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm && amm
  ```
