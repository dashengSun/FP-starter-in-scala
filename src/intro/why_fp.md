# Why FP?

There are lots of people knows OO, but really less people understand FP. Once someone marries with FP, they never want to go back. It just makes me feel happy and right. A few phenomenon since I wrote code in FP with Scala:

* Haven't debug for a really long time.
* The code is readable, nearly no comments.
* Easily mock in unit test.
* Less bug.
* Makes me love to be a developer.
